d 'CFBY': module to compare datasets and produce discrepancy rates
d 
d   cfby compares the variables in varlist from the dataset in
d memory to the variables in varlist from the using dataset and
d displays the discrepancy rates by a common variable.  It is
d useful if you are doing data entry and want to get discrepancy
d rates of data entry officers.

d 'OUTREG2': module to arrange regression outputs into an illustrative table
d 
d outreg2 provides a fast and easy way to produce an illustrative
d table  of regression outputs. The regression outputs are produced
d piecemeal and are  difficult to compare without some type of
d rearrangement. outreg2  automates this process by concatenating
d the successive regression ouputs in a  vertical format. The
d resulting table is saved to the disk in ASCII  format, which can
d be read by other programs. outreg2 thus facilitates  the
d convertion of regression outputs to a standard format suitable
d for  inclusion in a scholarly publication. The functionality of
d outreg2 is based on the earlier package outreg,  by John Luke
d Gallup. Unlike outreg, outreg2 is capable of writing LaTeX-format
d tables, as well as ASCII, MS Word and MS Excel.

d 'CFOUT': module to detect differences between datasets
d 
d    cfout compares the variables in varlist from the dataset in
d memory to the variables in varlist from the using dataset and
d saves a list of differences to a .csv file.  It    is useful if
d you are doing data entry and want to get an easy-to-work-with
d list of discrepancies between the first and second entries of a
d dataset.    readreplace makes many replacements from a very
d specifically-formated .csv file.  It is intended for use with the
d output from cfout.

d strgroup matches similar strings together. This can be useful

d not merge with "widgetts" because the strings are not identical.
d strgroup provides a way to match strings in an objective and
